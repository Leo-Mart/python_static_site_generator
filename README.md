# python_static_site_generator

A static site generator built in Python. This project was built as part of the [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) curriculum. The html/CSS was provided by the course. I wrote all the Python code.

Check out a little demo [here](https://leo-mart.github.io/python_static_site_generator/)

This was a fun but very challenging project. I have used tools like this in the past to convert markdown to html, so building this project was a nice way to see how those kind of tools actually work. It was also good to build unittests and to get into the habit of doing so.

### Some potential further improvments:
- Front-matter for post metadata.
- Multiple layouts (themes for pages vs posts)
- Simple theming system (dark/light for instance)
- Better post listings (e.g. an index page with post summaries.)
- Tags and tags-index-pages. (in conjuction with front-matter)
- And plenty of other stuff.
